## Overview
This document outlines the architecture and key business considerations for integrating GenAI (specifically LLM-based solutions) within our organization. The goal is to provide a balanced view that caters to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The focus is on fostering informed discussions about infrastructure choices, integration patterns, and system dependencies rather than prescribing specific solutions.

## Use Cases
The primary use case for this GenAI solution is a **Japanese Language Assistant** designed to support students and teachers during teaching and studying sessions. The assistant facilitates various learning activities, including:

- **Writing Practice App**: Assists users in structured writing exercises.
- **Text Adventure Immersion Reading**: Enhances engagement through interactive AI-generated narratives.
- **Light Visual Novel Immersion Reading**: Provides story-driven learning experiences.
- **Sentence Constructor**: Helps users build grammatically correct and meaningful sentences.
- **Visual Flashcard Vocab**: Supports vocabulary acquisition through AI-generated flashcards.
- **Speak to Learn**: Enables spoken interaction for language learning.

## Complexity
### Key Questions for Stakeholders:
- How many additional components does this introduce to our workload?
- Is this a simple integration or a system requiring continuous monitoring and updates?
- What dependencies exist between internal and external systems?

### Complexity Breakdown:
1. **Multiple Components**: The architecture integrates a payment gateway, language learning portal, vector databases, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a sentence constructor leveraging LLMs.
2. **Maintenance Considerations**:
   - Model updates and fine-tuning require periodic re-evaluation.
   - The system includes caching mechanisms to optimize performance.
   - Guardrails must be continuously updated to ensure AI-generated responses align with expected standards.
3. **Monitoring Needs**:
   - Continuous evaluation of AI responses for accuracy and relevance.
   - Monitoring costs and system load due to AI inference demands.

## Key Levers of Cost
Understanding the major cost drivers helps in financial planning and optimizing resource allocation:

1. **Compute Resources**:
   - The system considers free-tier and open-source LLMs such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4-turbo mode, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini 2.0 Flash.
   - Cloud-based or on-prem infrastructure decisions impact costs.
2. **Storage Requirements**:
   - A vector database is used for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), impacting storage and query costs.
3. **API Calls and Network Usage**:
   - Internet-based retrieval increases potential data transfer costs.
4. **Scaling Needs**:
   - The system must scale dynamically based on user demand, affecting provisioning strategies.

## Vendor Lock-in Considerations
A flexible technical strategy ensures that we are not locked into a single vendor or solution:

- **Open-Source LLMs**: Exploring open models reduces dependency on proprietary AI services.
- **Modular Architecture**: Ensuring each component (vector DB, RAG, cache, LLM, etc.) can be swapped out as needed.
- **Cloud-Agnostic Deployment**: Using containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to support multi-cloud and on-prem solutions.
- **Interoperability Standards**: Leveraging APIs and standard data formats to ease transitions between services.

## Essential Components for Deployment
Ensuring a reliable and ethical GenAI deployment involves several critical aspects:

### Guardrails
- **Input Validation**: Pre-processing user queries to avoid inappropriate content.
- **Output Filtering**: Ensuring AI-generated responses meet ethical and quality standards.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Regular audits to reduce AI biases in generated content.

### Evaluations
- **Continuous Performance Assessment**: Monitoring LLM accuracy and relevancy over time.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Leveraging user inputs to refine AI outputs.
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing different AI models or configurations to optimize user experience.

### Sandboxing via Containers
- **Containerized Deployments**: Utilizing Docker/Kubernetes to encapsulate AI workloads.
- **Version Control**: Tracking and managing different AI model iterations in isolated environments.
- **Security Isolation**: Ensuring LLM inference runs in controlled and secure environments to prevent data leaks.

## Conclusion
This architecture is designed to be flexible, scalable, and maintainable while addressing key business concerns around complexity, cost, and vendor lock-in. By leveraging guardrails, evaluations, and containerization strategies, we aim to ensure a responsible and efficient deployment of a Japanese language assistant to support both students and teachers.
